# Identifying Digital Evidence
The following are tasks investigators perform when working with digital evidence:
1. Identify digital information or artifacts that can be used as evidence.
2. Collect, preserve and document evidence.
3. Analyze, identify and organize evidence.
4. Rebuild evidence or repeat a situation to verify that the results can be reproduced reliably.

## Rules of Evidence
It must be kept in mind that evidence admitted in a criminal case might be used in a civil suit and vice versa.

**Hearsay**: Statement made while testifying at a hearing by someone other than an actual witness to the event. The United States excludes hearsay except for some conditions including the following:
1. Business records, including those of a public agency.
2. Certain public records and reports.
3. Evidence of the absence of a business record or entry.
4. Learned treatises used to question an expert witness.
5. Statements of the absence of a public record or entry.

Generally, digital records are admissible if they qualify as business records.

**"Best evidence rule"**: To prove the content of a written document, a recording, a photograph, ordinarily the original file is required.

## Collecting Evidence in a Private Sector Incident Scene
To investigate employees suspected of improper use of company assets, a company policy about misuse of digital assets allows private sector investigators to conduct covert surveillance with little or no cause and access company computer systems and digital devices without a warrant. Law enforcement officers can't do the same, however, without sufficient reasono for a warrant.

During a company policy investigation, if evidencce of a crime is discovered:
1. Determine whether the incident meets the elements of criminal law.
2. Inform management of the incident.
3. Stop your investigation to make sure you don't violate Fourth amendment restrictions on obtaining evidence.
4. Work with the corporate attorney to write an affidavit confirming your findings.

## Processing Law Enforcement Crime Scenes
**Probable cause**: Facts or circumstances that lead a reasonable person to beleive a crime has been committed or is about to be committed.

Law enforcement officers may search for and seize criminal evidence only with probable cause. Once probable cause is established, the law enforcement officer can obtain a search warrant from a judge.

### Warrant Terminology
- **Innocent information**: Information not related to the case but will be found when searching for evidence.
- **Limiting phrase**: A search warrant includes a limiting phrase that describes how to separate out innocent information.
- **Plain view doctrine**: Objects falling in plain view of an officer who has the right to be in a position to have that view are subject to seizure without a warrant and may be introduced in evidence.
- **"Knock and announce"**: With few exceptions, warrants require that officers knock and announce their identity when executing a warrant.

## Preparing for a search
The following steps are to be followed:
1. **Identify the nature of the case**: See if the case incolves the private or public sector. This step dictates how we proceed further and what type of resources we need to use in the investigation.
2. **Identify the type of computing system**: This step may be a little difficult because the crime scene isn't controlled. However, if the system can be identified, estimate the size of the drive on the suspect's computer and how many computers to process at the scene. Furthermore, determine the hardware and OSes.
3. **Determining whether you can seize a computer**: Law enforcement officers need a warrant to remove computers form a crime scene and transport them to a lab. However, if removing computers will irreparably harm a business, the computers cannot be taken offsite. If the computers cannot be taken to the lab, determine the resources required to acquire digital evidence and which tools can speed data acquistion.
4. **Obtaining a detailed description of the location**: After gathering information, identify potential hazards by interacting with the HAZMAT team. At a hazmat scene, put the target drive in a hazmat bag and have the HAZMAT technician decontaminate the bag. Also, check for high temperatures.
5. **Determine who is in charge**: In corporate cases, there is only one person to respond. However, law enforcement agencies handle large-scale investigations and designate lead investigators.
6. **Using additional technical expertise**: Looking for specialists when working with OSs, RAID server etc. can be challenging. Specialists must be educated in investigative techniques to prevent evidence damage.
7. **Determining the tools required**: Prepare tools using incident and crime scene information. Have an initial response kit ready (it must be lightweight and easy to transport).
8. **Preparing the investigation team**: Review the facts, plans and objectives with the investigation team you have assembled. The goal of scene processing should be to collect and secure evidence. Also, slow response can cause digital evidence to be lost.

To secure a digital incident or crime scene, the goals should be to preserve the evidence and keep information confidential. A secure perimeter must be defined using yellow barrier table and legal authority. Professional curiosity of police officers and other professional who aren't part of the crime scene processing team can destroy evidence and must be prevented.

## Seizing Digital Evidence at the Scene
With a proper warrant, law enforcement cam seize evidence. Corporate investigators can rarely seize evidence. When seizing computer evidence in a criminal investigation, follow US FoJ standards for seizing data. Civil investigations follow the same rules but require less documentation. 

1. **Preparing to acquire digital evidence**: The evidence that we acquire depends on the nature of the case.
2. **Processing an incident ot crime scene**: A journal must be kept to document all activities. The scene must be secured by removing people who are not part of the investigation. Take video recordings of the area around the computer. The computers must be checked as soon as possible. Don't cut electrical power to the system and save data from the current application and record all active windows or shell sessions. Once data is copied from a live suspect computer, close applications and shut down the computer. Also, look for information related to the investigation such as passowrds, passphrases, PINs and bank accounts and collect the documentation and media replated to the investiagation.
3. **Processing data centers with RAID systems**: Sparse acquisition is a technique for extracting evidence from large systems by extracting only data related to evidence for the case from allocation files. While this minimizes the amount of data to be analyzed, it doesn't recover data in free or slack space.
4. **Using a technical advisor**: A technical advisor can help you list the tools needed to process the incident or crime scene and can guide you about where to locate data and help you extract log records. Also, the TA can help create the search warrant by itemizing what's required for the warrant. The TA should know aspects of the seized system, direct investigator handling sensitive material, help secure the scene, help document the planning strategy, condict ad hoc trainings and document activities.
5. **Documenting evidence in the lab**: A detailed record of activities and findings must be kept. The goal should be to be able to reproduce the same results when another investigator repeats the steps you took.
6. **Processing and handling evidence**: The integrity of the digital evidence must be maintained in a lab in the same way it's done at the crime scene. 

## Storing Digital Evidence
The media used to store evidence depends on the estimated length of how long it will need to be kept. Magnetic tapes should be used for long term storage. To help maintain the cahin of custody for digital evidence, the access to the lab and evidence storage area must be restricted. The lab should have a sign in rooster for all visitors. The work should be done with the assumption that the data might need to be retained indefinitely.

Creating and using an _event custody form_ is a good idea. It identifies the evidence, who has handled said evidence and when the evidence has been handled. Additionally, hashes can also be added to the event custody form.
