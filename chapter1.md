# Chapter 1: Understanding Digital Forensics
## Introduction
In October 2012, ISO 270037 "Information Technology -- Security Techniques -- Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence" was passed.

**Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)**: Signed into law in 1973 was created to standardise evidence procedures. 

**FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART)**: Formed in 1984 to handle the increase in cases that required processing digital evidence.


### History of Digital Forensics
1. In 1980s, general purpose OSes such as DOS became available. Tools in this period were created by government agencies like the IRS and were written in C or assembly. These tools were not available to the general public.
2. In the mid 1980s, the tool *XTree Gold* became available to the genral public. Norton DiskEdit soon followed.
3. By early 1990s, *International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)* introduced training for digital forensics software. However, no GUI tools were available until *Expert Witness* was introduced for Macintosh.
4. Now, a lot of excellent tools such as AccessData Forensic Toolkit (FTK) are available to the general public.

**Case law**: In cases where statutes or regulation do not exist, case law allows legal counsel to apply previous similar cases to current ones in an effort to address ambiguity in laws.

## Preparing for Digital Forensics Investigations
### Public Sector Investigations
> **The Fourth Amendment**: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.

A criminal case follows three stages: the complaint, the investigation and the prosecution. Once the complaint is filed, the *police blotter* is checked to find any similar crimes and discover patterns. Whether or not a police officer is capable of handling digital evidence is determined whether the offices falls into one of two categories: **Digital Evidence First Responder (DEFR)** i.e. skilled in taking precautions to preserve digital evidence or a **Digital Evidence Specialist (DES)** i.e. skilled in analyzing the acquired data.

As an examiner assigned to a case, the following steps must be followed:
1. Assess the scope of the case, which includes the devices's OS, hardware and peripheral devices.
2. Determine whether resources are available to process all the evidence. Determine whether you have the tools to analyze the evidence.
3. Once all the resources are gathered, the next task is to delegate, collect and process the information related to the complaint.
4. After collecting the evidence, the information is turned over to the prosecutor. 

### Private Sector Investigations
**Authorized requester**: A person within an organization that has the power to initiate investigations.


As a digital investigator and forensics professional, youâ€™re expected to maintain honesty and integrity. You must conduct yourself with the highest levels of integrity in all aspects of your life. Any indiscreet actions can embarrass you and give opposing attorneys opportunities to discredit you during your testimony in court or in depositions.

When collecting evidence, follow the search and seizure procedures that government agents might have to follow as there is always a possiblity that the case might turn into a criminal investigation.


## Approaching a Case
### Taking a Systematic Approach
The following steps must be followed when conducting a digital investigation:
1. **Initial assessment**: Make an initial assessment about the type of case you're handling.
2. **Initial design**: Determine a preliminary design or approach to the case i.e. outline the general steps you need to follow to investigate the case.
3. **Checklist**: Create a detailed checklist and refine the general outline by creating a detailed checklist that includes the steps that need to be followed along with a time estimate for each step.
4. **Required resources**: Determine the resources required i.e. list the software you plan to use.
5. **Obtain evidence**: Obtain and copy an evidence drive i.e. make a forensic copy.
6. **Risk identification**: Identify the risks i.e. list the problems you normally expect in the type of case being handled. This is known as a *standard risk assessment*.
7. **Risk mitigation**: Mitigate or minimize the risks i.e. take necessary precautions to overcome the identified risks.
8. **Testing**: Test the design by reviewing the decisions already made by you. This also includes drive verification using hashes.
9. **Analysis and recovery**: Analyze and recover the digital evidence using the software tools gathered.
10. **Investigation**: Investigate the data you have recovered including files, deleted files, emails, web history etc.
11. **Reporting**: Complete the case report by writing a detailed report that includes the stpes followed and a summary of findings.
12. **Critiquing**: Critique the case by performing a self assessment or peer review. Identify any mistakes made by you and how they can be avoided in the future.
