# Current Digital Forensics Tools
### Types of Digital Forensics Tools
Digital forensics tools are divided into two major categories: hardware and software:

1. Hardware forensics tools: Range from single purpose tools like  Tableau T35es-R2 SATA/IDE eSATA bridge to complete systems like Digital Intelligence F.R.E.D systems.

2. Software forensics tools: Could be GUI or command line. Could be specialized or general purpose.

## Tasks Performed by Digital Forensics Tools

> **Note**: When testing new tools, follow the guidelines set up by NIST's Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) program, ASTM International's E2678 standard, the International Organization on Computer Evidence (IOCE). ISO standard 27037 states that Digital Evidence First Responders (DEFRs) should use validated tools.

The functions performed by digital forensics tools are:

1. [Acquisition](-Acquistion)
2. Validation and Verification
3. Extraction
4. Reconstruction
5. Reporting
